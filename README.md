# sunapsis-alert-module
This is an alert service spring boot application created to move custom institution-specific alerts to the institution folder

# please run the file at this path src/main/java/org/synopsis/alerts

Please ignore the rest of the files in the initialization repo. This spring boot project was created to enhance this service but  haven't added any dependencies to pom.xml to run it as a springBoot app because there is no need for enhancing as this is as this is a  small work. 

To run the code, please pull the code to the  local machine and run the AlertService.java file separately
